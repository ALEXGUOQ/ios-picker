### Running the Demo Project

1. Get an API Key
  - Go to [Filepicker.io](www.filepicker.io) to register an account.
  - API Keys are typically randomized and 20 characters long.

2. Open `FPPicker Demo/FPPicker Demo.xcodeproj`

3. Set your Filepicker API Key
  - Add `#import <FPPicker/FPPicker.h>` to your app delegate (i.e., typically `AppDelegate.m`)
  - Add the following code on your app delegate and use the API Key you got after registering:

    ```objc
    + (void)initialize
    {
        [FPConfig sharedInstance].APIKey = @"SET_FILEPICKER.IO_APIKEY_HERE";
    }
    ```
4. Build and Run
