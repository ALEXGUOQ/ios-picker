### Running the Demo Project

1. Get an API Key
  - Go to [Filepicker.io](www.filepicker.io) to register an account.
  - API Keys are typically randomized and 20 characters long.

2. Open `FPPicker Demo/FPPicker Demo.xcodeproj`

3. Set your Filepicker API Key
  - Go to `Your app's target` > `Info` > `Custom iOS Target Properties` and add the following key/value pair:

  ```
  Key: "Filepicker API Key"
  Value: YOUR_API_KEY (that you got from step 1)
  ```

  - Your list should now look like this:
