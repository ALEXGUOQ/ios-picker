If you need to enable security or customize store options, please follow the instructions below:

### Enabling Security

Go to your app's delegate implementation (i.e. `AppDelegate.m`), locate `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` and add:

```objective-c
[FPConfig sharedInstance].appSecretKey = @"SET_FILEPICKER.IO_APPSECRETKEY_HERE";
```
**NOTE:** This setting is required if security is enabled in Developer Portal.

### Customizing Store Options

Go to your app's delegate implementation (i.e. `AppDelegate.m`), locate `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` and add:

1. **Store Access**

  Indicates that the file should be stored in a way that allows public access
  going directly to the underlying file store.

  - Valid values are `public` or `private`
  - Defaults to `private`

  ```objective-c
  [FPConfig sharedInstance].storeAccess = @"private";
  ```

2. **Store Container**

  The bucket or container in the specified file store where the file should end up.

  ```objective-c
  [FPConfig sharedInstance].storeContainer = @"some-alt-container";
  ```

3. **Store Location**

  Where to store the file.

  - Valid values are `S3`, `azure`, `dropbox` and `rackspace`
  - Defaults to `S3`

  ```objective-c
  [FPConfig sharedInstance].storeLocation = @"S3";
  ```

4. **Store Path**

  The path to store the file at within the specified file store.

  For S3, this is the key where the file will be stored at.

  **NOTE:** For S3, please remember adding a trailing slash to the path (i.e. `my-custom-path/`)

  ```objective-c
  [FPConfig sharedInstance].storePath = @"some-path-within-bucket/";
  ```
